One key area where AI shines is in analyzing project risks. It helps us identify potential issues early on, assess their likelihood, and predict how they could affect the overall timeline or outcome. By processing large amounts of data quickly, AI can also spot patterns or trends that might not be immediately obvious to the team, which is crucial for making informed decisions.","In terms of how my feelings have evolved, I've become even more appreciative of AI's capabilities. Initially, I saw AI as just a tool for handling repetitive tasks or providing quick answers. However, as I've interacted with it more and applied it to analyzing project risks and enhancing our project's scope, I’ve realized that it can add significant value in ways I hadn't anticipated. It's not just about automating tasks or answering questions; it can really help with decision-making, offering data-driven insights that make the whole process more efficient."
