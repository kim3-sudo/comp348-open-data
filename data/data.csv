It should be used in introductory and advanced courses makes learning fun, easier and faster.","Yeah, I think I’ve got a basic understanding of how it works. Generative AI models like GPT are trained on tons of text from the internet, books, articles, and so on. The model looks at patterns in the way words are used and learns to predict what comes next in a sentence. So when you ask it something, it’s not pulling from a database of answers—it’s actually generating responses on the spot, one word at a time, based on what it’s learned. It doesn’t truly “understand” things the way humans do, but it’s surprisingly good at sounding like it does because of how well it’s trained to mimic language.","I don’t personally feel much hesitancy using AI, especially when I see how helpful it can be with things like learning, writing, or organizing my thoughts. But I do understand why some people might be hesitant. A lot of it comes down to trust—like, how do we know the information AI gives us is accurate or unbiased? There's also the worry about privacy, or the fear that AI might replace human jobs. To someone who’s all-in on AI, I’d just say it’s smart to stay cautious, not because AI is bad, but because it's powerful—and powerful tools need thoughtful use. It’s not about fear; it’s about being responsible. To help ease hesitancy, I think showing people how AI can support, not replace, what they’re already doing—and being open about its limitations—goes a long way.","AI-generated code can be surprisingly clean and well-structured, especially for common problems or well-documented tasks. It’s really good at writing boilerplate code, solving standard algorithms, or helping you get unstuck when you’re not sure how to start something. It’s also great for explaining code or fixing simple bugs. But it struggles with more complex, context-heavy tasks—like if your project has a bunch of dependencies or weird edge cases, AI might miss those or make assumptions that don’t really work. Also, sometimes it gives you code that *looks* right but doesn’t actually run, so you still need to test and think critically about it."

I see a general trend of people getting hyper-dependent on AI. While it helps with efficiency, it makes people prone to missing out on real opportunities to learn. AI shouldn't be used for reasoning, but for refining ideas and already-made work. ","As someone who rarely used AI for writing code, my answer for this question is not going to be very accurate since it is based on a very small sample. I think AI-generated code does not factor in things like time complexity and space complexity. AI also may write an unnecessarily long code for a fairly simple task, and this relates to my earlier point. Lastly, It is possible that the choice of data structures used in the AI-generated code may not be optimal as well. 

I would imagine that the complexity of the code written affects the quality of AI-generated code such that as complexity increases, quality and correctness is likely to decrease. "
